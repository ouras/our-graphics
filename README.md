# our-graphics
Simple no-dependencies Rust graphics library with basic linear algebra types, 3D primitives, and rendering tools.

An example `main.rs` file is included, whose dependencies are in `Cargo.toml`. Note there is a bug in the dependencies which requires Rust `1.47.0`.

Partially inspired by the "Fundamentals of Computeer Graphics" (4th edition) by Marschner, Shirley, et. al.
